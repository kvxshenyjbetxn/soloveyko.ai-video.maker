    "tokens_label": "Maximum token limit for the AI response. Controls the length of the generated text and helps avoid overspending or incomplete answers.\nIf you set a limit of 128,000 tokens, it doesn't mean the AI will always respond with a length of 128k tokens; it is a constraint that the AI cannot exceed.\nTherefore, for a complete response, it is recommended to set a limit of 128,000 tokens. It is the maximum.",
    "temperature_label": "The model's creativity parameter. Lower values (0.1–0.5) ensure accuracy and stability,\nwhile higher values (0.8–1.5) make the text more varied but less predictable.",
